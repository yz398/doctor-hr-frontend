This project is to help people to get the data from the docker via the browser. The goal for this project is to help students learn how to build browser simply and get to know how to use Material-UI et al.  

In this project, I built a browser to get heart rate data from the docker. Users should enter a valid email address to get the data. All the data under this email address will be presented in the table.  
The initial state of the browser:  
![404 Not Found](https://github.com/yz398/doctor-hr-frontend/blob/master/initial.png)
When users get data:  
![404 Not Found](https://github.com/yz398/doctor-hr-frontend/blob/master/test.png)
http://localhost:3000/
